    "i)\tarticulating one or more advantages /benefits of cultured meat and/or materials required to make cultured meat (e.g., “low-cost, edible, and highly customizable scaffolds”, “growth serum”), such as animal welfare (e.g., mentioning that it will reduce the need for livestock farming), non-use of animals or animal components (e.g., mentioning that there are no animals involved), and lessened environmental impact (e.g., stating that it is more sustainable or results in less greenhouse-gas emission);\n",

    "iii)\tsharing any research finding and/or survey result that consumers are willing to try cultured meat;\n",

It is often used in a negative context, suggesting that these methods create unnatural or unhealthy meat products);\n",

    "iii)\tsuggesting that cultured meat is not necessary;\n",
